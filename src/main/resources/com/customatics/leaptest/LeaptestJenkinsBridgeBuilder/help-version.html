    In future there is going to be more versions, but now threre is only one "1.1.0".
    This version works in such way:<br>
    1. Get all available schedules to launch <br>
    2. User chooses schedules to run <br>
    3. Launch schedule <br>
    4. Get schedule state <br>
    5. Repeat 3 and 4 if until there are no more schedules to run chosen by user.<br>
    Only one build step per job is allowed! You can avoid this limit using pipeline!
